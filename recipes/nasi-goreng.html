      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>

      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>Â½ pound peeled and deveined shrimp</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>3 cups cold cooked white rice</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons kecap manis (sweet soy sauce)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Coat with nonstick
        cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour eggs into the hot skillet and cook until the edges begin to set.
        Lift the edges to allow any uncooked egg to flow onto the hot pan, about
        1 minute. Flip omelet in one piece and cook until fully set, about 30
        seconds. Transfer omelet to a cutting board and slice into 1/2-inch
        strips. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat vegetable oil in a wok or large frying pan over high heat. Stir in
        onion, leek, chile peppers, and garlic. Cook and stir until onion is
        soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in chicken, shrimp, coriander, and cumin; mix
        well. Cook and stir for about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix in cooked rice, sweet soy sauce, and omelet strips; cook until rice
        is heated through and chicken is no longer pink in the center, 3 to 5
        minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
